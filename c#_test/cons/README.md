The original problem described here.
https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/aneo

You enter a section of road and you plan to rest entirely on your cruise control to cross the area without having to stop or slow down.

The goal is to find the maximum speed (off speeding) that will allow you to cross all the traffic lights to green.

Warning: You can not cross a traffic light the second it turns red !

Your vehicle enters the zone directly at the speed programmed on the cruise control which ensures that it does not change anymore.

```
Input
Line 1: An integer speed for the maximum speed allowed on the portion of the road (in km / h).

Line 2: An integer lightCount for the number of traffic lights on the road.

lightCount next lines: 

- An integer distance representing the distance of the traffic light from the starting point (in meters).
- An integer duration representing the duration of the traffic light on each color.

A traffic light alternates a period of duration seconds in green and then duration seconds in red.
All traffic lights turn green at the same time as you enter the area.

Output
Line 1: The integer speed (km / h) as high as possible that cross all the green lights without committing speeding.


Constraints
1 ≤ speed ≤ 200
1 ≤ lightCount ≤ 9999
1 ≤ distance ≤ 99999
1 ≤ duration ≤ 9999

```
The important nuance not described in the original description is you must use only an integer number of kilometers per hour. 
If you will use double or float and calculate more preciselly you will not pass the last test because your correct result will be 24.68 m/sec

Robert Eisele made a perfect [description](https://www.xarg.org/puzzle/codingame/aneo-sponsored-puzzle/) of all approaches and optimizations possible in this solution so I just put it here in file "ANEO Sponsored Puzzle.html".
