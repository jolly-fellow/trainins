A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element
 of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.

For example, in array A such that:

        the element at index 5 has value 7 and is unpaired.

Write a function:

/*
 A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is initially located on one bank of the river
 (position 0) and wants to get to the opposite bank (position X+1). Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.
 You are given an array A consisting of N integers representing the falling leaves. A[K] represents the position where
 one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds.

 The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.
 The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position across the river from 1 to X
 (that is, we want to find the earliest moment when all the positions from 1 to X are covered by leaves).
 You may assume that the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves do not change their
 positions once they fall in the river.

 For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 4
  A[4] = 2
  A[5] = 3
  A[6] = 5
  A[7] = 4

In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river.

Write a function:

    int solution(int X, vector<int> &A);

 that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers and integer X, returns the earliest time when the frog can
 jump to the other side of the river.

if A[K] = X, such that 1 ≤ X ≤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.

For example, given integer N = 5 and array A such that:

A[2] = 4
A[3] = 6
A[4] = 1
A[5] = 4

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.
Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
    • 0 represents a car traveling east,
    • 1 represents a car traveling west.
The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 ≤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.
For example, consider array A such that:
A[0] = 0 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 0 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 1
We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).
Write a function:
int solution(vector<int> &A);
that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the number of pairs of passing cars.
The function should return −1 if the number of pairs of passing cars exceeds 1,000,000,000.
For example, given:
A[0] = 0 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 0 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 1
the function should return 5, as explained above.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    • N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
    • each element of array A is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1.

A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters A, C, G and T, which correspond to the types of
 successive nucleotides in the sequence. Each nucleotide has an impact factor, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types
 A, C, G and T have impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. You are going to answer several queries of the form:
 What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?

The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting of N characters. There are M queries,
which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers. The K-th query (0 ≤ K < M) requires you to
 find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive)

For example, consider string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:
    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6

The answers to these M = 3 queries are as follows:

        The part of the DNA between positions 2 and 4 contains nucleotides G and C (twice), whose impact factors
        are 3 and 2 respectively, so the answer is 2.
        The part between positions 5 and 5 contains a single nucleotide T, whose impact factor is 4, so the answer is 4.
        The part between positions 0 and 6 (the whole string) contains all nucleotides, in particular nucleotide
        A whose impact factor is 1, so the answer is 1.

Write a function:

    vector<int> solution(string &S, vector<int> &P, vector<int> &Q);

that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters and two non-empty arrays P and Q consisting of M integers,
 returns an array consisting of M integers specifying the consecutive answers to all queries.

Result array should be returned as a vector of integers.

For example, given the string S = CAGCCTA and arrays P, Q such that:
    P[0] = 2    Q[0] = 4
    P[1] = 5    Q[1] = 5
    P[2] = 0    Q[2] = 6

the function should return the values [2, 4, 1], as explained above.

        M is an integer within the range [1..50,000];

MaxProductOfThree

Description:

A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] (0 ≤ P < Q < R < N).
For example, array A such that:

contains the following example triplets:
    • (0, 1, 2), product is −3 * 1 * 2 = −6
    • (1, 2, 4), product is 1 * 2 * 5 = 10
    • (2, 4, 5), product is 2 * 5 * 6 = 60
Your goal is to find the maximal product of any triplet.
Write a function:

For example, given array A such that:

the function should return 60, as the product of triplet (2, 4, 5) is maximal.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

/*
You are given two non-empty arrays A and B consisting of N integers. Arrays A and B represent N voracious fish in
 a river, ordered downstream along the flow of the river.

The fish are numbered from 0 to N − 1. If P and Q are two fish and P < Q, then fish P is initially upstream of fish Q.
 Initially, each fish has a unique position.

Fish number P is represented by A[P] and B[P]. Array A contains the sizes of the fish. All its elements are unique.
 Array B contains the directions of the fish. It contains only 0s and/or 1s, where:

        0 represents a fish flowing upstream,
        1 represents a fish flowing downstream.

If two fish move in opposite directions and there are no other (living) fish between them, they will eventually meet each other.
 Then only one fish can stay alive − the larger fish eats the smaller one. More precisely, we say that two fish P and Q
 meet each other when P < Q, B[P] = 1 and B[Q] = 0, and there are no living fish between them. After they meet:

        If A[P] > A[Q] then P eats Q, and P will still be flowing downstream,
        If A[Q] > A[P] then Q eats P, and Q will still be flowing upstream.

We assume that all the fish are flowing at the same speed. That is, fish moving in the same direction never meet. The goal is to calculate the number of fish that will stay alive.

For example, consider arrays A and B such that:
  A[0] = 4    B[0] = 0
  A[1] = 3    B[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2    B[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1    B[3] = 0
  A[4] = 5    B[4] = 0

Initially all the fish are alive and all except fish number 1 are moving upstream. Fish number 1 meets fish number 2 and eats it,
 then it meets fish number 3 and eats it too. Finally, it meets fish number 4 and is eaten by it. The remaining two fish,
 number 0 and 4, never meet and therefore stay alive.

Write a function:

    int solution(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B);

that, given two non-empty arrays A and B consisting of N integers, returns the number of fish that will stay alive.

For example, given the arrays shown above, the function should return 2, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000];
        each element of array B is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1;
        the elements of A are all distinct.

/*
 An array A consisting of N integers is given. The dominator of array A is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.

For example, consider array A such that
 A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
 A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3

The dominator of A is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of A (namely in those with indices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and 5 is more than a half of 8.

Write a function

    int solution(vector<int> &A);

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns index of any element of array A in which the dominator of A occurs. The function should return −1 if array A does not have a dominator.

For example, given array A such that
 A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
 A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3

the function may return 0, 2, 4, 6 or 7, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647]
